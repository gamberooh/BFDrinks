        <p> 
            The Higher Education Institute 'Belluzzi-Fioravanti' was established on September 1st, 2011<br>
            following the merger of two historic Bolognese institutions, the 'Odone Belluzzi' Technical Industrial Institute and the 'Aristotele Fioravanti'<br>
            Professional Institute for Industry and Crafts.<br>
            The creation of the new school aimed to establish a technical-professional hub in the southwest area of Bologna,<br>
            capable of adequately interpreting the objectives set out by the reorganization of secondary education<br>
            and the birth of the new regional system of education and vocational training. The single headquarters in Via Cassini<br>
            now accommodates all students of the 'Belluzzi-Fioravanti' I.H.S.; it is located on the border between the Municipality of Bologna,<br>
            to which it belongs, and the Municipality of Casalecchio di Reno."
